# Reminders

1. In epup.html, variant builder fails to provide a section where you can edit the img src file when you click on the sponsor logos. The solution was I had to manually update the src link.

2. Similar work will probably have to be done with the RealSkills Logo on the nav bar for when the screen is minimised.
