# rse-web-v3
Version 3 for RSE Website

Template bought from Themeforest



# How to use Website Template

-> = go into that folder

RSE Google Drive -> IT-> rse-web -> rse-latest_date.zip

Download rseweb-latest_date.zip file

Unzip file

rseweb-latest_date -> Stack 2.0.6 -> variant

open Builder.html (website template)

Pages tab (top left-hand corner on builder.html)

  - Import pages (latest pages are in RSE Google Drive -> IT-> rse-web->pages, download them)

rseweb-latest_date -> Stack 2.0.6 -> Images

Add images to this folder/page to add to website



# Host Website

Pages (top left-hand corner on builder.html)- down the bottom, export as .html

Put all the files in the public folder on GitHub repo (rse-web-v3)



# Reminders

1. In epup.html, variant builder fails to provide a section where you can edit the img src file when you click on the sponsor logos. The solution was I had to manually update the src link.

2. Similar work will probably have to be done with the RealSkills Logo on the nav bar for when the screen is minimised.
